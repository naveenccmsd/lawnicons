[![Build release APK](https://github.com/naveenccmsd/singleicons/actions/workflows/build_release_apk.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/naveenccmsd/singleicons/actions/workflows/build_release_apk.yml)

SingleIcons is fork from lawnicons and more icons from different lawnicons forks.

## Why SingleIcon
Loved lawnicons, Still many icons are missing, there are many other lawnicons forks available,Sadly can't use them at same time.
Lawnchair didn't support custom icons yet.
So I created my own app adding more icons from different lawnicons forks.


## Download

See the [Releases](https://github.com/naveenccmsd/singleicons/releases) section to download the latest stable build of Lawnicons.(Poting still in progress...will upload apk once it completed)

For the development versions with new icons, go to the [Actions](https://github.com/naveenccmsd/singleicons/actions) tab,
click the first workflow run, and scroll and find the `Debug Apk`.

Note that you'll need to have a GitHub account to download the debug apk.

## Install

Uninstall any Lawnicons or it's fork before installing this apk.

## Adding icons
I don't create new icons in this repo insted will get latest icon from offical repo and add/update here.
If you find official icons missing here or have suggestions to add more lawnicons forks, create an issue I will update latest icons.
