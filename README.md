SingleIcons is port of [Arcticons](https://github.com/Donnnno/Arcticons) into [Lawnicons](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons) and merger of lawnicons and some of it's forks into single app.
The idea is to fill missing icons for lawnicons from other icon pack , like Arcticons,TeamFiles,RKicons etc..

## Lawnicons

Lawnicons is an add-on for adding themed icons to [Lawnchair 12 Alpha 5](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair) and above.
This addon is now the source of all themed icons, for simplicity.

## Versions 

### SingleIcons versions

- LTA
- ALT

L - LawnIcons

T - TeamFiles-LawnIcons

A - Arcticons

The Icons will be created from former and missing icons will be replaced by latter.
Example, LTA will have all icons from **LawnIcons** and missing icons will be replaced by **TeamFiles-LawnIcons** then replaced by **Articons**
